# Unity-Projects

Some Unity projects I worked on for VR class.

## Physics

-   Implemented basic physics concepts.
-   Built a mortar cannon that can fire cannonballs to break walls.
-   Also used a trigger to play sounds whenever the bell is hit.

## Joints

-   Used different joints to simulate the movement of a robot.
-   Made the robot turn towards a target object.

_In case a project doesn't run, empty `Project/Library/PackageCache` and try again._
